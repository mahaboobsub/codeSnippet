![alt text](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)


![alt text](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)

A simple, full-stack web application for managing and commenting on code snippets, built with a React frontend and Node.js microservices.

<!-- You can replace this with your own screenshot -->

‚ú® Key Features

Create & View Snippets: Add new code snippets with a title and view all existing snippets in a clean card layout.

Commenting System: Each snippet has a dedicated section for adding and viewing comments.

Microservice Architecture: Demonstrates separation of concerns with dedicated services for snippets and comments.

Real-time UI Updates: The interface automatically refreshes when new snippets or comments are added.

In-Memory Database: Both backend services use a simple in-memory object for data storage, making the project easy to run without a database setup.
